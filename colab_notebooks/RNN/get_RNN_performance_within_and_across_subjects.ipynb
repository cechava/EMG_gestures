Performance is assesed within each subject and across subjects. In the 'across subject' case, the model is trained on data from one subject and data from all other subjects is used as the test data. Overall, gesture classification performance on held-out data is quite high when the training and test data come form the same subject, but significantly drops when the test data comes from other subjects.\n","\n","The following notebooks in this repo contain useful data and analysis pipeline details:\n","- data_exploration_and_quality_check_demo.ipynb\n","- single_subject_classification_demo.ipynb\n","\n","RNN model performance is compared with performance form a simpler logistic regression in:\n","- compare_model_performance_within_and_across_subjects.ipynb\n","\n","&emsp; The folder containing this notebook is expected to contain a utils.py script (containing custom functions for data wrangling and analysis) and the EMG_data folder (downloaded from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EMG+data+for+gestures#)\n","\n","***NOTE***: Training a RNN mode can take a while when using a CPU.
