# limb-position-EMG

Personal project exploring different types of classifiers for the task of classifying limb positions from EMG data collected with a MYO thalmic bracelet.

The data set was provided by the UC Irvine ML Repository and can be downloaded from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EMG+data+for+gestures#

**Currently putting together notebooks highlighting results and explaining technical approach.**
